# VERSION 1 PROTOTYPE INFOS
This prototype is the first one we've ever done, of course it's imperfect but its a very special one inside our hearts.<br>
Unfortunately we couldn't include the lower part of the arm since the school's 3D printer literally blew up and we didn't even time to unfortunately include the wrist or the palm even though they aren't too hard to include.<br>
We had a total of circa 7 months to make it and we're really happy of the results, so much that it was even brought to some finals and the Ferrara HoPE team were **AMAZED**.<br>
It's really funny to see how something that is not even hard to code becomes this good.

This prototype was really cool to make.<br>
It was something new we wanted to experience and MIT's HoPE project at school was the perfect excuse to stop procrastinating.<br>
I've always been closed inside myself, everytime I used to get home I'd close myself into my coding for my projects, but this was the first time I put myself to code something with people **in real life**.<br>
I'm still a lot closed but hey, now I'm one step further! Besides, FINALLY I've worked on something about robotics!! My childhood dream!!!<br>
Now that I'm done with school I'll start going to uni, yet I've decided to return next year once per week at school just to help the team work further into this project.

Forever in love with my coding creations,<br>
