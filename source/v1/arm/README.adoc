= Project: Robotic Arm - Arm part

This project is about a robotic arm that gets controlled by a glove via Wi-Fi.
This 3D printed arm, is big enough to contain several servomotors that will rotate based on the glove's arduino's incoming data to the arm's one:

 * The rotation of 3 of them will pull strings attached to several fingers, making them _"flex"_.
 * The rotation of one of them will make the wrist rotate horizzontally.
 * The rotation of a mini servo will make the thumb rotate horizzontally.
3 fingers were conjoined for a stronger grip.

== Step 1: Installation
1. Download this sketch or use Arduino CLoud directly [RECOMMENDED to use at best this Sketch as Thing]
2. Configure your Wi-Fi credentials and sync the degrees variables among the Arm and Glove Things
3. Attach your Arm arduino board to this sketch

== Step 2: Print the 3D components, put them together and assemble the circuit
**NOTE:** In these tests the _palm_ and _wrist_ were **not** used.

== Step 3: Load the code
Upload the code contained in this sketch on to your board.

=== BOM
At the moment, the total amount for the Arm is 80€ circa and you'll also need a 3D printer.
Besides the big 3D arm and finger pieces, strings, a breadboard and pin male/female cables, you'll also need some specific parts:
|===
| ID | Part name             | Part number | Quantity
| S1 | 15kg Servomotors pack | B0C4T73SMB  | 1 (4 if not as pack)
| S2 | Mini Servomotor       | B0BBR4RB5H  | 1                   
| R4 | Arduino UNO R4 WiFi   | ABX00087    | 1
